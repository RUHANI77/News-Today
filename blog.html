                    <p>Ver : scope of a var variable is functional scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. It can be declared
                    without initialization. It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”. hoisting done ,
                    with initializing as 'default' value.
                    
                    Let : The scope of a let variable is block scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It can be
                    declared without initialization. It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give 'referenceError'.
                    Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the let variable before
                    declaration/initialization
                    
                    Const : The scope of a const variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. It cannot be
                    declared without initialization. It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without
                    initialization. Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the const variable
                    before declaration/initialization</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-2">What is the difference between regular functions and arrow functions?</h4>
                    <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular
                    functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable
                    and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Unlike regular functions, arrow
                    functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
                    lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-3">What are the differences between forEach(), map(), find() and filter()?</h4>
                    <p>forEach() : The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array. The forEach() method returns
                    “undefined“. The forEach() method doesn’t return anything hence the method chaining technique cannot be applied here. It
                    is not executed for empty elements. It is an ECMAScript5 (ES5) feature.
                    
                    map() : The map() method creates an entirely new array. The map() method returns the newly created array according to
                    the provided callback function. With the map() method, we can chain the other array Instance methods i.e returned value
                    of the map() method invokes the next method in the chain. It does not change the original array. It calls a function
                    once for each element in an array.
                    
                    find() : The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. The find() method finds
                    the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to the leaf. The find() method search through all the child
                    elements only. It does not execute the function for empty elements. It does not change the original array. This method
                    returns undefined if no elements are found.
                    
                    filter() : The filter() method is used to filter all the elements. The filter() method returns the element that matches
                    and removes the element that does not match. The filter() method search through all the elements. The filter() method
                    does not change the original array. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements. In filter()
                    method a value is passed to the function as its this value</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-4">Why we use template string in javascript?</h4>
                    <p>Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is called string
                    interpolation.</p>
